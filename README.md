# Modeling Data with Long and Short History Features

This repository outlines our approach to modeling data characterized by a mix of long and short history features. Our primary goal is to ensure that the short-history features, which may have missing data or sparse values, do not negatively impact the modeling of long-history features.

## Tasks

The main tasks to be carried out include:

1. **Imputation**
   - This step focuses on filling in missing or sparse values in the dataset. 
   - It ensures that short-history features, which may not have data values over the entire historical period, are populated so that they can be effectively used in modeling alongside long-history features.

2. **2-Stage Modeling**
   - **First Stage**: Develop individual models for both long-history and short-history features. This allows us to focus on each set of features independently.
   - **Second Stage**: Combine the predictions of the first stage into a unified model. This can either be done using meta-modeling techniques or by using the outputs of the first-stage models as input features to a second-stage model.

3. **Ensembling**
   - Combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy. 
   - Techniques such as bagging, boosting, and stacking can be employed to blend models and leverage the strengths of each individual model.

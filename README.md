# Modeling Data with Long and Short History Features

This repository provides guidelines and methods to model data with both long and short history features. Our primary goal is to address challenges arising from datasets that have features with varying temporal histories, ensuring that features with sparse or incomplete histories are properly integrated without negatively impacting the model's performance.

## Project Guideline

### **Baseline Model - XGBoost**
- Before diving into complex modeling structures, we'll establish a baseline model using XGBoost. 
- The performance of XGBoost will serve as a reference to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of our more intricate approaches.

### 1. Imputation


### 2. 2-Stage Modeling


### 3. Ensembling



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (version x.x or higher)
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost, etc. (You may need to add specific versions or other libraries based on your methods.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [[repository-link]](https://github.com/yihonghhe/Project_Creditbly.git)https://github.com/yihonghhe/Project_Creditbly.git

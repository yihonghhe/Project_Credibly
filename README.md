# Modeling Data with Long and Short History Features

This repository provides guidelines and methods to model data with both long and short history features. Our primary goal is to address challenges arising from datasets that have features with varying temporal histories, ensuring that features with sparse or incomplete histories are properly integrated without negatively impacting the model's performance.

## Project Guideline

### **Baseline Model - XGBoost**
- Before diving into complex modeling structures, we'll establish a baseline model using XGBoost. 
- The performance of XGBoost will serve as a reference to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of our more intricate approaches.

### 1. Imputation

Imputation is the foundational step in our modeling pipeline:

- Address missing values or sparse data in the dataset.
- Ensure that features, especially those with short histories, are populated uniformly to facilitate subsequent modeling.
- Use techniques tailored to the nature of the data and the type of missingness.

### 2. 2-Stage Modeling

After data preprocessing, we proceed with a two-tiered modeling approach:

- **First Stage**: Create separate models for both long-history and short-history features. This isolation allows us to accommodate the unique characteristics of each feature set.
  
- **Second Stage**: Integrate the predictions from the first stage to form a unified model. This can be achieved through various meta-modeling techniques or by using the first-stage outputs as inputs for a second-stage model.

### 3. Ensembling

To refine our predictive accuracy, we turn to ensembling:

- Combine models to enhance prediction accuracy and mitigate individual model weaknesses.
- Use advanced techniques like bagging, boosting, or stacking to synergize the strengths of various models, including those from the 2-stage modeling.
